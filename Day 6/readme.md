# Day 6

Today we added persistence to our reverse shell via the command `:p newfile.exe` or `:persist newfile.exe`, which simply creates a copy of the current executable in `%LOCALAPPDATA%` with the name specified and adds it to the `Run` registry key.

Plans for the next streams:
  - Refactoring the code to become cleaner
  - Creating a little `help` command
  - Encrypting strings and decrypting them at runtime
  - Add a simple linux version
  - Include option to write modules that get injected through commands
  - Possible AV evasion tactics
  - and much more...
