# Day 3

Today we just improved the download a bit, creating two types. We have a local download, same as before and a remote download
which retrieve files from the url. The command becomes: `:u r https://etc...` for remote downloads and `:u l file.exe` for local downloads.
We also added a new upload feature, allowing you to upload files to the machine.

Plans for the next streams:
  - Refactoring the code to become cleaner
  - Creating a little `help` command
  - Encrypting strings and decrypting them at runtime
  - Add a simple linux version
  - Include option to write modules that get injected through commands
  - Possible AV evasion tactics
  - and much more...
