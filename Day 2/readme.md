# Day 2

Today we cleaned the code up a bit and added some error handling.

We also added a new upload feature, allowing you to upload files to the machine.

PS: During the stream there was a problem I couldn't fix. Well, right after turning the stream off I figured it out.
It turns out it's quite obvious. The client was detecting when the file data ends based on a string `::OVER::`. I was
trying to upload the actual `server.exe` as a test. Well... this binary has the `::OVER::` string in it, which when it hits, 
makes it think the message was over, truncating the file. 

So, it actually works, except it doesn't work for uploading a file that has this specific string in it. We will fix it next stream :D
