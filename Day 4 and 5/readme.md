# Days 4 and 5

The basic portion of the reverse is now complete! It's usable and useful and all its functions are working!

In days 4 and 5 we implemented then runtime string decryption and our download function that mirrors the local uplaod function but
for downloading from the client's computer to the server's machine.
We also refactored the code a little bit.

Plans for the next streams:
  - Creating a little `help` command
  - Add a simple linux version
  - Include option to write modules that get injected through commands
  - Possible AV evasion tactics
  - and much more...
